## Description 

This project was assigned to us by Horiseon to help refactor their exisiting website to allow for it to be easier to read. I was motivated to finish this project because I believe in the good work that Horiseon can provide and am willing to help them achieve their goals. This solves the problem that the website had bad code in it and it was preventing the ability for viewers to easily understand what Horiseon can do.

## Learning Points 

Throughout the development of this webpage, I was able to learn about HTML and CSS elements and how they interact with diferent web browsers.
I used my knowledge gained to help reorganize code to make things easier to understand, when attributes had the same properties.

## Credits

I would like to shoutout some of my classmate; Kayla Dutte, Stephanie Lenorovitz, Samuel Thomas, Sonam Sherpa, Jacob Kachmarek, Lainey Creighton and Joel Longares for assisting me with debugging and helping me to understand where some of my mistakes were made. All code was either supplied to me via starter code (found in deployment e51cae3), or entered by myself. I also utilized the MDN sites above to help understand concepts and how to use proper syntax, but all code was entered by myself.
